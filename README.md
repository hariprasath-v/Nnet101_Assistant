## Project Overview
This chatbot leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions about neural networks. It combines a retriever to find relevant answers from a curated dataset and a generator to deliver clear, concise responses, making it a valuable tool for users seeking foundational knowledge in neural networks.

## Data Collection
The data for this project was gathered using the StackExchange API and focuses on fundamental questions related to neural networks.
You can find the data [here](https://github.com/hariprasath-v/Nnet101_Assistant/blob/main/data/Stackoverflow_data(neural_networks_stats)_pre_processed_Gemini_LLM.csv)

## Architecture
The chatbot architecture is built on a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** framework that combines vector-based search with language model generation for accurate and concise responses:

1. **Vector-Based Search with ElasticSearch**: User queries are processed as vector embeddings and searched against a database using **ElasticSearch** to retrieve the most relevant information.

2. **Prompt Creation**: The retrieved results are dynamically formatted into a structured prompt, which is fed into a **Large Language Model (LLM)**.

3. **Response Generation**: The LLM processes the prompt and generates a clear, concise summary tailored to answer the userâ€™s question accurately.
