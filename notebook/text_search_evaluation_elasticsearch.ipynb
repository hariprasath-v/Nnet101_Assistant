However, guidelines exist for setting the number and type of network layers, as well as the number of neurons in each layer.\\n\\n**Initial Architecture Setup**\\nBy following specific rules, one can establish a competent network architecture. This involves determining the number and type of neuronal layers and the number of neurons within each layer. This approach provides a foundational architecture but may not be optimal.\\n\\n**Iterative Tuning**\\nOnce the network is initialized, its configuration can be iteratively tuned during training. Ancillary algorithms, such as pruning, can be used to eliminate unnecessary nodes, optimizing the network's size and performance.\\n\\n**Network Layer Types and Sizing**\\nEvery neural network has input, hidden, and output layers.\\n\\n* **Input Layer:** Number of neurons is determined by the number of features in the training data.\\n* **Output Layer:** Number of neurons is determined by the model configuration (regression mode has one node, classification mode uses softmax for multiple classes).\\n* **Hidden Layers:** Number of layers and neurons can be determined empirically, with one hidden layer often being sufficient. Rule of thumb suggests the hidden layer size should be between the input and output layer sizes.\\n\\n**Optimization**\\nPruning techniques can be employed during training to reduce network size and improve performance.
