formulation of attention, the query represents the input to be matched, while the keys and values store the candidate matches and their associated information.\\nLike a search engine, attention's query is matched against a set of keys, and the best matched values are returned.\\nThis retrieval process involves calculating a probability vector alpha, which determines the proportion of each value to include in the output.\\n\\nThe first paper (Bahdanau et al. 2015) calculates alpha using a neural network, which is computationally expensive.\\nThe second paper (Vaswani et al. 2017) proposes a more efficient approach, where the keys and values are first projected onto a common space, and then a similarity measure is used to calculate alpha.\\nThis approach corresponds to the retrieval system concept, where the query and key projections are analogous to the user query and video metadata, respectively.\\n\\nMultihead attention extends this key/value/query formulation by splitting the inputs into multiple heads and applying attention to each head independently.\\nThe outputs of each head are then concatenated to produce the final attention output.\\n\\nThe source of the queries, keys, and values depends on the application.\\nFor self-attention (as in language models), they all come from the same source.\\nFor tasks like machine translation, queries and keys can come from different sources (e.g., target and source sequences, respectively).\\nIn recommendation systems, queries can represent target items, while keys and values can represent user profiles and

\"**Network Configuration in Neural Networks**\\n\\n**Standardization**\\nThere is no single standardized method for configuring networks. However, guidelines exist for setting the number and type of network layers, as well as the number of neurons in each layer.\\n\\n**Initial Architecture Setup**\\nBy following specific rules, one can establish a competent network architecture. This involves determining the number and type of neuronal layers and the number of neurons within each layer. This approach provides a foundational architecture but may not be optimal.\\n\\n**Iterative Tuning**\\nOnce the network is initialized, its configuration can be iteratively tuned during training. Ancillary algorithms, such as pruning, can be used to eliminate unnecessary nodes, optimizing the network's size and performance.\\n\\n**Network Layer Types and Sizing**\\nEvery neural network has input, hidden, and output layers.\\n\\n* **Input Layer:** Number of neurons is determined by the number of features in the training data.\\n* **Output Layer:** Number of neurons is determined by the model configuration (regression mode has one node, classification mode uses softmax for multiple classes).\\n* **Hidden Layers:** Number of layers and neurons can be determined empirically, with one hidden layer often being sufficient. Rule of thumb suggests the hidden layer size should be between the input and output layer sizes.\\n\\n**Optimization**\\nPruning techniques can be employed during training to reduce network size and improve performance. This involves identifying and removing nodes that do not significantly impact network performance. Optimizing network configuration can be achieved by initially setting a larger number of neurons and then using pruning to refine the network.\",\n","    \"id\": \"f55240b8\"\n","  },\n","  {\n","    \"question\": \"What should I do when my neural network doesn&#39;t learn?\",\n","    \"tags\": \"neural-networks|faq\",\n"]}],"source":["!head /workspaces/Nnet101_Assistant/data/nnet_101_qna_with_id.json"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[],"dockerImageVersionId":30786,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.12.1"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
