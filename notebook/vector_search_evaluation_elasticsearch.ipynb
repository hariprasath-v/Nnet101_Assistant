There are two main types of pooling layers: max-pooling and mean-pooling.\\n\\n**Max-pooling** selects the maximum activation value within a block of data, prioritizing the presence of a specific feature in a general area. However, it can lose information about low activations within that block.\\n\\n**Mean-pooling** calculates the average activation value within a block, which can smooth out large activations. It retains some information about low activations but may not capture the presence of specific features as strongly as max-pooling.\\n\\nThe choice between max-pooling and mean-pooling depends on the desired level of feature extraction and the importance of preserving low activation information.',\n","   'tags': 'machine-learning|deep-learning|feature-engineering|computer-vision'}},\n"," {'_index': 'nnet101',\n","  '_id': 'vaWrapIBD6eHS5kjAZXb',\n","  '_score': 0.7557167,\n","  '_source': {'question': 'What is global max pooling layer and what is its advantage over maxpooling layer?',\n","   'answer': '**Summary:**\\n\\nGlobal max pooling is a type of max pooling where the pool size is equal to the input size. Unlike regular max pooling, which produces a smaller output, global max pooling produces an output with the same dimensionality as the input.\\n\\nIn global max pooling, the maximum value across the entire input is extracted, providing a representation that focuses on the most prominent feature. This is useful in applications like natural language processing, where the most important words in a sentence are often indicative of its meaning.\\n\\nIn contrast, regular max pooling divides the input into smaller segments and extracts the maximum value from each segment, reducing the output size. This is more common in computer vision, where spatial information is important and reducing the size of the representation can be beneficial for computational efficiency.',\n","   'tags':
